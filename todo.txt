* update dired to not open new window on click
(maybe not a good idea?)
scratch this, being able to do both is better.

* nano modeline and nano child frame for M-x
not so sure on child frame now...

* hydra being main throughout
need a template to work from?
hydra wont work everywhere but a "main hydra" accesable everywhere with frequently used commands?
then depending the major mode have a majormode specific hydra? eg pdf tools

* Clean up Bit warden, look at keepass?
Keepass might be good but lack of android app, and a lot of set up. maybe in the future.
Bitwarden is the one.

* dotfiles/orgfiles when installing new programs or packages etc

* Projectile.
along with projectile - move keybindings to a central location. with correct mappings.

* Embark? act on items in consult like kil buffer ect. worth looking into
